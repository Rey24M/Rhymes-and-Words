   <h1>I Wish</h1>
   </div>
   
   <div class="text"> 
      <t> I wish I could reach the other horizon
     To leave the shore and go on discovering
<br>Find a place that is mine to belong
<br>Where I have everything for which I long
<br>A world animated out of my thoughts
<br>That's what I want

      <br><br>
    
     I wish I could touch the end of the sky
<br>Just for the sake of getting high
<br>I want to purify the air of affection
<br>And come back with a sense of satisfaction

     
      <br><br>
      
       I wish I could colour someone's black and white dream
<br>To weave a dream that never finished
<br>Make them realise that nothing ever ends
<br>That nothing ever stays

      <br><br>
      
       I wish I could flow in sync with the wind
<br>Go away everywhere in a single ride
<br>Never stay put for something
<br>That was never mine to begin with

       <br><br>
        Just never ever stop, I wish
        <br><br>
