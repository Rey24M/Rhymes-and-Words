      <t> Seeing the employment crisis and people not able to go home I shed blood laden tears
    <br>Looking at the suffering of people and their hearts filled with fears. 
    <br> Today we stand divided with our minds clouded with sorrow
    <br>But is there nothing to enlighten humanity's tomorrow.
      <br><br>
    
     There is a moon even in the darkest night
    <br>Guiding the lost with it's delicate ray of light
    <br>Though there are sufferings and pain in this dark holiday
    <br>To enlighten the future can't the rise of nature be seen as a light ray.
     
      <br><br>
      
       In this lockdown forests and wildlife have come to life and in the pure atmosphere flowers bloom
    <br>Far away sights can be seen which were once blocked by the smog of gloom
    <br> Rivers are restored with pure water, air is clean
    <br> The revival of nature can be prominently seen.
     
      <br><br>
      
       Lockdown has given us an opportunity to right our wrong
    <br> It has taught me to see in a new way and in the tough times how can we stay strong
    <br> Even when separated, together this crisis we can bear
    <br> By giving emotional and mental support to each other and show mother Earth that we care.
      
      <br><br>
      
     Wars for resources and death are destined for the exploitation path on which we advance
    <br>Lockdown has reset the earth and to restore what we have exploited, it has given us a second chance
    <br> To bond with nature with our mind and heart
    <br>And prevent the gruesome future by starting a life with nature as a part
    <br> This shows how forgiveness has always been Mother Earth's trait
    <br>Who has given us a second chance to reflect and rewrite our fate.
