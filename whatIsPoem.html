   <h1>What is 'I'?</h1>
   </div>
   
   <div class="text"> 
      <t> If we think about what is “I”
      <br>Does it reveal the truth or bury it in the grave of a lie
      <br>Does it join with love or give way to hate
      <br>Does it complete our lives or destroy our fate
      <br><br>
    
     “I” can give rise to pride which leads us to downfall
      <br>And closes our ears to success’s fading call
      <br>“I” when used wrongly, ego takes lead
      <br>It arrests our thinking ability and inculcates greed
     
      <br><br>
      
       On the other hand if we think, what is “I”
      <br>It can be the shoulder upon which others can trust to cry
      <br>It can be the one with whom joys and sorrows others can feel free to share
      <br>It can be the one to assure when no one stays with you “I am there”
      <br><br>
      
       I can portray responsibility or on others it can put the blame
      <br>It depends on it’s use whether it will destroy you or it will bring you fame
      <br>I when joins with other words determines we will be witty or sly
      <br>Only we can control it if we think what is “I”
