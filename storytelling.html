 Storytelling is an ancient and valuable art that extends around the globe. It has been practiced since ages. Its history dates back to that of humanity itself. It has evolved from cave paintings to artistic sketches to modern art, from tribal dances to classical forms, to contemporary moves, from primitive symbols to ancient scripts to modern writing, from folk songs to classical melodies to modern tunes, from early records to classic literature to grandma tales and so much more. Every form mentioned is a unique and special way to perform the same simple task of telling a story.
 <br><br>
 Anything made with imagination tells a beautiful story. There are infinite ways of expressing one’s views. It can be as simple as saying it directly or as complicated as a hidden essence in a play. As you continue to take interest in storytelling, you will be given a chance to enter the land of imagination. Irrespective of all your characteristics, the land of imagination welcomes you to a world of endless creativity.
 <br><br>
 As you enter in this realm, you are confronted by the various paths of storytelling. The yellowish white path of parchment with gleaming ink allows you to pen down your story with tales, essays, poems and novels. The colourful street jewelled with paint splotches and pencil strokes gives you a chance to give your story an artistic look with paintings, sketches, graffiti and cartoons. A narrow lane of craft runs along and lets lift your art from paper to the real world in the form of puppetry, sand art, pottery and miniatures.
 <br><br>
 The heavily crisscrossed way dotted with strings and keys and notes and tunes lets you weave your story into music in the form of vocal songs and instrumental melodies. The parallel path to music covered in gorgeous costumes, with intriguing moves, expressions, rhythm and energy helps you to present your story with grace and beauty in the form of dance. In due course these five paths intertwine to form a new lane which shows your story with dialogues, colour, props, music, dance and its own twist of action in the form of plays and movies.
 <br><br>
 The ways I mentioned are just a few of many. The realm of imagination has many more surprises in store for you. So feel free to explore its nooks and corners and streets and alleys for who knows what might grab your interest.
 <br><br>
 Storytelling has a strange magic that transports you to a new world, a world filled with mysteries. It is school for learning new ideas, an office for working on ideas and a market for the exchange of ideas. For me, it is a refuge from the world as well as a window to the world.
 <br><br>
 See you, in the land of imagination.
